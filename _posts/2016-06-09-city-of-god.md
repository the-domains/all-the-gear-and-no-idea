## Day 11 - Oloron to Lourdes

The last day of our tour was a Sunday, God's day, and we left Oloron in beautiful conditions headed for Lourdes via the stunning Pyrenees National Park with its contrast of snow capped mountains and rich semi-tropical foothills. The sky had cleared and was a brilliant blue set against the snow capped mountains.

We'd had to change our plan because of storms over the top of the Pyrenees. We'd played safe and headed north directly into France and then east along the Haute Pyrenees on the north side instead of east through Spain then over the large climbs that take you to Lourdes directly. For two days the tops of the mountains were engulfed in cloud, which from previous experience the last week meant we could have gotten into serious trouble. 

Because of this change we'd lost out on topping our target of 14,000m climbing but by the end had achieved just over 12,000m. In total we'd climbed and ridden along three mountain ranges, including four decent peaks and dozens of smaller mounts and hills. Most of it we had ridden but had to dismount at times when the gradient was just too steep and a couple of times the air too thin, as at over 1,500m altitude your oxygen capacity begins to diminish. Our highest climb was 1,900m and I remember at times at those having to stop every couple of hundred metres to catch my breath.

We'd made the right choice in avoiding the storm and were to be rewarded for it. Our ride on Sunday was perhaps one of the best, a shorter 60km the weather was on our side. We had sunshine the whole day and the roads were quiet of traffic as we went through some of the most beautiful villages in the region.

It was with less than an hour left on our ride together that we had our Butch and Sundance moment, after taking a small diversion alongside the river Pau, which was being used by white water rafters, canoeists and for fishing. We'd realized that we were now at the end our toughest of the three rides so far and were actually able to stop and savour the moment. After today, Sam was continuing on to Toulouse while I was heading to Nice the following morning on business. We'd completed nearly 800km of the 1,000km together (Sam would go on to add 100km+ by the time he reached Toulouse, while I would a couple of 40km rides in deference).

Lourdes was our final destination, which as the French say is tres particuliere, and was unlike any other place we had stopped in so far on the trip. An old Roman fortified town, in the 1850's a miracle was affirmed when a young girl had several apparitions of the Virgin Mary, which transformed the city. Now Lourdes is second only to Paris in terms of tourism and hotel accommodation capacity as more than 6m people a year visit what is considered Catholicism's third most important destination after Rome and the Holy Land.

Centred around the cave with a shrine pouring healing spring water, there is a resplendent cathedral, centred amongst beautiful gardens and buildings with ornate decoration throughout. No matter what time of day, there are hundreds and thousands of the devout in quiet procession throughout the building and past the site of the miracle and on the grounds of the cathedral. The crowds would ebb and flow with each of the six to eight services per day, which is broadcast through the grounds and available online. The last service of the day is a procession of light that's akin to something you'd see in the Magic Kingdom.

A striking feature of the town was also the industry that has built up around around the sacred venue. As well as having over 250 hotels from budget to five star, there are countless religious souvenir shops selling all manner of statues, candles, mini fountains t-shirts with the Pope on them and even plastic bottles of varying sizes to harvest your own miracle water. This was a full on religious tourism destination, unlike St Jean Pied du Port, which was a staging post. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fcd59808-14f6-40cc-8130-b6d454b43ae1.png)

Historically, a place for Catholics, you get a wider sense of spirituality here with many nations of the world converging on this place of their chosen faith. There is something peaceful and special about being there, people come to search and find their answers, no matter what those are.

Whether it's the 10 commandments, Buddhism's five moralities, nine basic beliefs of Hinduism, 11 Sikhist doctrines, the 12 rules of Karma or the Pagan's rule of three. When read and understood, they all seem to come to a core mantra. In the words of the Fonz -- be cool.

Over the two days we had ridden 143km and climbed over 2000m, burning between 7,000 and 9,000 calories. The intense heat the both days had seen us drinking six litres of water each day.

The trip had been by far the best of the four I had taken, more demanding, more satisfying and different to anything before, although we'd seen beautiful towns and villages in France. Spain is a very different place but the mountains are another world.
